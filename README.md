This plugin allows code blocks executed interactively like jupyter notebooks. It is based on HTTP REST APIs and JS sandbox and Webassembly technology, and has no local environment requirements, so it supports all platforms supported by Obsidian.

Supports all Obsidian supported platforms, includes:
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux
- Android
- IOS

Currently, support languages:

- Rust
- Kotlin
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python
- Java

**Note**: Only `Python`„ÄÅ`TypeScript`„ÄÅ`JavaScript` are run locally in sandbox(js / webassembly). Other's will send
code to third-party website to eval the results (eg: https://play.kotlinlang.org, https://play.rust-lang.org).
Please take care to avoid sending your potentially-sensitive source code.
